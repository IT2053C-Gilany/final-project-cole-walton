    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",

    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",

    "Fields: The dataset contains MLB player-level and pitch-level data fields such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "player_name – Player’s name\n",
    "\n",
    "year – Season year\n",
    "\n",
    "team – MLB team abbreviation\n",
    "\n",
    "handedness – Left- or right-handed batter/pitcher\n",
    "\n",
    "exit_velocity_avg – Average exit velocity of batted balls\n",
    "\n",
    "launch_angle_avg – Average launch angle\n",
    "\n",
    "whiff_rate – Percentage of swings that result in a miss\n",
    "\n",
    "chase_rate – Percentage of swings at pitches outside the strike zone\n",
    "\n",
    "barrel_rate – Rate of well-hit balls (“barrels”) per batted ball event\n",
    "\n",
    "woba – Weighted On-Base Average (overall hitting performance)\n",

    "Data Set Selection Rationale: I chose the pybaseball dataset because it provides real MLB Statcast data, the same kind that professional teams use for player evaluation. As someone interested in baseball analytics and scouting, this dataset directly connects to my career goals. It allows me to analyze player performance trends, find data-driven insights, and create visualizations similar to what front-office analysts use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to Be Answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "How are plate discipline and power connected?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Do hitters with lower chase and whiff rates tend to have higher exit velocity or barrel rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: Teams want players who combine contact skill and power — this shows which players actually achieve that balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do these relationships differ between left-handed and right-handed hitters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: Understanding handedness trends can inform scouting, lineup decisions, and player development strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Are these metrics improving or changing over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Has average exit velocity or whiff rate changed over the past five seasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: Reveals league-wide evolution in hitting approaches — “launch angle era,” power focus, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s the correlation between advanced metrics and results (like wOBA)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Value: Helps identify which underlying skills (discipline or power) most predict offensive success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization Ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter Plot (Matplotlib/Seaborn):\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: exit_velocity_avg (x) vs whiff_rate (y)\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Visualize the trade-off between contact and power; highlight players who excel at both.\n",
    "\n",
    "Box Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: exit_velocity_avg grouped by handedness\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Compare left- vs right-handed hitter power profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line Chart (Time Series):\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: Average whiff_rate and exit_velocity_avg by year\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Track how player tendencies have changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation Heatmap:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: exit_velocity_avg, barrel_rate, whiff_rate, chase_rate, woba\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Histogram or Density Plot:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable: Distribution of barrel_rate across players\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Identify how rare elite contact quality really is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive Scatter Plot (Plotly):\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables: exit_velocity_avg vs whiff_rate, hover showing player name and woba\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight: Let users explore player-level trends interactively.\n",

    "(Optional) Bar Chart:\n",
    "\n",
