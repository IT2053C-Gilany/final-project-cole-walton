    "### Data set selection rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why did you select this data set?\n",
    "\n",
    "I selected this data set beacause it goes perfectly with what I love to do as a hobby. For a while now I have enjoyed doing data analysis on MLB teams and players and I am thrilled that now I can do it through python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "> Using statistical analysis and visualization, what questions would you like to be able answer about this dataset.\n",
    "> This could include questions such as:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between X and Y variables?\n",
    "> - What is the distribution of the variables?\n",
    "> - What is the relationship between the variables and the target?\n",
    ">   You will need to frame these questions in a way to show value to a stakeholder (i.e.why should we know about the relationship between X and Y variables?)\n",
    "1. Is there true correlation between having high spin rates and pitching success?\n",
    "2. How much does launch angle matter in comparision to exit velocity for having long term success?\n",
    "3. Are hitters who don't chase often as valueable as they seem?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "> Provide a few examples of what you plan to visualize to answer the questions you posed in the previous section. In this project, you will be producing 6-8 visualizations. You will also be producing an interactive chart using Plotly.\n",
    "> Think about what those visualization could be: what are the variables used in the charts? what insights do you hope to gain from them?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1 I will first make a scatterplot with the x axis being spin rates and the y axis being pitching war or era. This will give us a good look at each individual player. Then I will create a bar chart and seperate spin rates into a couple different categories (good, bad, elite) and show how thier success compares. \n",
    "For 2 I will make scatterplots for both launch angle and exit velocity, seeing which one has more correlation with success. I then make a graph with exit velo as the x and launch angle as the y and see how valueable it is to be good in both of those aspects. \n",
    "For 3 I'll create bar charts showing how successful different increments of chase rate hitters perform over different years. I think this will do a great job not only showing how it affects the players throughout one season, but also how much of an effect it has on long term consistency.\n"
